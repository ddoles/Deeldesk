# **1\. Executive Summary**

## **The Promise vs. The Reality**

Every sales technology vendor promises to "10x sales productivity with AI." It's not happening. Why? Because AI can only work with the data it has access to, and the most critical data in enterprise sales—the strategic decisions that determine deal outcomes—has never been digitized. It exists in sellers' heads, whiteboard sessions, Slack threads, and the countless iterations of proposals that never get saved.

**You can't 10x what you can't see.**

## **The Deeldesk.ai Solution**

Deeldesk.ai is an AI-powered proposal generation platform that helps sellers create and iterate on sales presentations faster than ever before. But beneath this productivity surface lies something more profound: **the first system of record for sales strategy.**

By helping sellers create proposals, we capture the strategic decisions that were previously invisible—how they position against competitors, how they structure pricing, how they configure solutions for specific customers. Every proposal iteration is a window into deal strategy as it evolves.

## **Two Products in One**

| What Sellers See | What Enterprises Get |
| ----- | ----- |
| AI proposal generator that creates presentations 10x faster | System of record for sales strategy capturing every PPS decision |
| Smart templates that learn from your best work | Digitization of previously invisible offline data |
| Version control and iteration tracking | Complete Deal Arcs showing strategy evolution |
| Collaboration tools for team selling | Analytics correlating strategy patterns with win/loss outcomes |

## **The Deal Arc: Filling the Data Gap**

Proposals are created in the critical gap between customer discovery and deal desk submission—exactly where strategy decisions happen. When combined with data from other systems (calls, emails, calendars, CRM), Deeldesk.ai constructs complete **Deal Arcs**: the full narrative of how deal strategy evolved from first call to closed-won or closed-lost.

## **Key Value Propositions**

* **For Sellers:** Create proposals 10x faster with AI that knows your products, pricing, and positioning  
* **For Sales Leaders:** See deal strategy as it evolves, not just final outcomes  
* **For Enterprises:** Digitize the offline data that determines wins and losses—with complete data sovereignty

## **Business Model**

PLG-first: sellers sign up for free and start creating proposals immediately. Enterprise conversion when organizations want Deal Arc analytics, integrations, and data sovereignty (BYOD/BYOS/BYOL). Target Year 1 ARR: $5-8M.

# **2\. The 10x Productivity Paradox**

## **The Broken Promise**

Every sales technology vendor in 2024-2025 promises AI-powered 10x productivity gains. The reality? Sales productivity metrics have barely moved. Ramp times remain stubbornly long. Win rates haven't meaningfully improved. The expensive veteran sellers are still irreplaceable.

The reason is simple: **AI can only amplify data that exists in digital form.** And the most important data in enterprise sales has never been digitized.

## **The Offline Data Problem**

Current sales technology captures the bookends of selling—customer data (CRM) and sales activity (call recordings, emails). But the strategic middle—where deals are actually won or lost—remains completely undigitized:

| What We Capture Today (Online Data) | What We Miss (Offline Data) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Call recordings and transcripts | Why we positioned this way against this competitor |
| Email threads and engagement | Why we structured pricing this way for this customer |
| CRM pipeline stages and updates | Why we configured this solution vs. alternatives |
| Calendar activity and meeting frequency | How strategy evolved based on customer feedback |
| Final quotes sent to deal desk | The 15 proposal iterations that led to that quote |

## **The Proposal Gap**

There's a critical data gap in every enterprise deal: the time between customer discovery and deal desk submission. This is when the strategic work happens—when sellers decide how to position, price, and solution. This work primarily manifests in **proposals and presentations**—the artifacts sellers create to communicate their strategy to customers.

These proposals are the richest source of strategic data in enterprise sales. They encode:

* **Positioning choices:** Which value props, which competitive angles, which proof points  
* **Pricing structures:** Discount levels, commercial terms, packaging decisions  
* **Solution configurations:** Product mix, implementation approach, scope boundaries  
* **Strategy evolution:** How positioning shifted across iterations based on feedback

But this data is lost. Proposals live in local folders, scattered across PowerPoint files with names like "Customer\_Proposal\_v7\_FINAL\_v2.pptx." No one captures the strategic decisions embedded in these documents. No one tracks how strategy evolved across iterations.

## **Why Direct Capture Fails**

The obvious solution—asking sellers to fill out forms about their strategic decisions—doesn't work. Sellers are compensated to close deals, not to document their thinking. Any system that adds friction to the sales process will be abandoned or gamed.

The only way to capture offline data is to make it **a byproduct of something sellers already want to do.**

# **3\. The Indirect Capture Strategy**

## **The Insight**

Sellers spend 4-6 hours per deal creating proposals and presentations. They hate this work—it's tedious, repetitive, and pulls them away from selling. If we can make proposal creation *dramatically faster and better*, sellers will eagerly adopt our tool. And in doing so, they'll **generate the strategic data that's never been captured before.**

## **The Trojan Horse**

| Surface Layer: Productivity Tool | Foundation Layer: Strategy Capture |
| ----- | ----- |
| "Create a proposal for \[Customer\] in \[Industry\] competing against \[Competitor\]" | Captured: Customer context, competitive landscape, positioning intent |
| "Add a slide showing our Enterprise pricing tier with 20% discount" | Captured: Pricing strategy, discount level, tier selection rationale |
| "Update the solution architecture to include Analytics module" | Captured: Solution configuration change, expansion strategy |
| "Create version 2 with stronger ROI messaging after customer feedback" | Captured: Strategy pivot based on customer reaction, iteration pattern |

## **What Proposals Reveal**

Every proposal created in Deeldesk.ai implicitly captures:

### **Positioning Decisions**

* Which value propositions were emphasized  
* How the seller differentiated against specific competitors  
* Which proof points and case studies were selected  
* How messaging evolved across proposal versions

### **Pricing Decisions**

* Which pricing tiers and products were proposed  
* Discount levels and commercial structure  
* How pricing changed across iterations  
* Packaging and bundling choices

### **Solutioning Decisions**

* Product/module configuration  
* Implementation scope and approach  
* Technical architecture choices  
* Expansion path and upsell positioning

## **The Critical Timing**

Proposals are created in exactly the right window to capture strategy:

| Stage | What Happens | Data Available |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Discovery Calls** | Learn customer needs, pain points, budget | Call recordings, transcripts (Gong) |
| **Proposal Creation** | Translate discovery into positioning, pricing, solution | **Deeldesk.AI CAPTURES THIS** |
| **Deal Desk / Quote** | Finalize pricing for contract | Final quote only (CPQ) |

The proposal creation phase is where strategy crystallizes—after discovery reveals customer needs but before the deal is locked in at deal desk. This is the missing data layer.

# **4\. Market Opportunity**

## **Market Size**

| Market Segment | Estimated Size (2025) |
| :---- | :---- |
| Presentation Software (PowerPoint, Google Slides) | $4.2 billion |
| Sales Proposal Software | $2.8 billion |
| Revenue Intelligence | $4.8 billion |
| Sales Enablement | $3.2 billion |
| **AI Proposal \+ Strategy Intelligence (TAM)** | **$8-12 billion (convergence)** |

## **The Convergence Opportunity**

Deeldesk.ai sits at the intersection of two massive trends:

* **AI Content Generation:** Massive adoption of AI tools for creating documents, presentations, and sales materials  
* **Sales Intelligence:** Growing demand for data-driven insights into sales performance and deal dynamics

No one else has recognized that AI proposal generation is the key to unlocking sales strategy data.

## **Why Now**

* **LLM Capability Threshold:** Models can now generate high-quality, contextual sales presentations  
* **AI Adoption Normalized:** Sellers already use ChatGPT; purpose-built tools are next  
* **Remote Selling:** Digital-first selling means more reliance on presentation materials  
* **Data Sovereignty Awareness:** Enterprises understand they need to own their AI training data

# **5\. Target Market & Buyer Personas**

## **The Two-Layer Market**

Deeldesk.ai serves two distinct but connected markets:

### **Layer 1: Individual Sellers (PLG Entry)**

| Attribute | Profile |
| :---- | :---- |
| **User Type** | Account Executives, Sales Consultants, Startup Founders, SEs |
| **Current Pain** | Spend 4-6 hours per deal on proposals; copy-paste from old decks; inconsistent quality |
| **What They Want** | Create better proposals faster; look professional; close more deals |
| **Buying Behavior** | Self-service; credit card; try before buy; individual decision |

### **Layer 2: Enterprise Sales Organizations**

| Attribute | Profile |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Company Type** | B2B software, technology platforms, complex solutions ($100M-$2B revenue) |
| **Sales Organization** | 20-200 quota-carrying AEs; dedicated sales ops/enablement |
| **Current Pain** | No visibility into deal strategy; knowledge locked in top performers; long ramp times |
| **What They Want** | Digitize strategy data; understand what wins deals; accelerate new seller productivity |

## **Primary Buyer Personas**

### **Persona 1: The Time-Starved AE**

**Mindset:** "I'm spending half my week on proposals instead of selling. I need to create better decks faster."

**Value Message:** "Create proposals 10x faster. Tell Deeldesk about your customer and competitor, and get a professional deck in minutes."

### **Persona 2: The CRO**

**Mindset:** "I have no idea how my sellers are positioning and pricing until deals hit forecast review. By then it's too late."

**Value Message:** "See deal strategy as it evolves, not just outcomes. Understand what positioning and pricing patterns win."

### **Persona 3: VP Sales Operations**

**Mindset:** "We have data on calls and emails, but we have no visibility into the strategic decisions that happen in between."

**Value Message:** "Complete your data stack. Combine proposal strategy data with Gong, Salesforce, and email to build full Deal Arcs."

# **6\. Product Vision: Two Products in One**

## **Vision Statement**

*Deeldesk.ai is an AI-powered proposal generation platform that sellers love to use—and in using it, they create the first system of record for sales strategy, enabling enterprises to finally understand and optimize the decisions that determine deal outcomes.*

## **The Dual Value Stack**

### **Seller Value (The Hook)**

* **10x Faster Proposals:** Describe the deal, get a professional presentation  
* **Context-Aware Generation:** AI knows your products, pricing, competitors, and templates  
* **Smart Iteration:** "Make it more aggressive on pricing" / "Add competitive slide against X"  
* **Version Control:** Track all iterations; never lose work; see what changed  
* **Team Collaboration:** SE and AE work on same proposal; manager can review

### **Enterprise Value (The Payoff)**

* **Strategy Digitization:** Every proposal captures positioning, pricing, and solutioning decisions  
* **Deal Arcs:** Complete narrative of strategy evolution when combined with other data sources  
* **Pattern Analytics:** What positioning wins? What pricing structures correlate with success?  
* **Knowledge Transfer:** New sellers see how top performers structure deals  
* **Strategy Governance:** See and influence deal strategy before customer exposure

## **How It Works**

1. **Seller Creates Proposal:** "Create a proposal for \[Customer\] in \[Industry\], we're competing against \[X\], budget is \[$Y\], the use case is \[describe use case\]."  
2. **AI Generates Presentation:** Deeldesk uses context store (products, pricing, templates, competitive intel) to create tailored deck  
3. **Seller Iterates:** "Add stronger ROI slide" / "Remove premium tier" / "Emphasize security more" — each iteration captured  
4. **Strategy Data Extracted:** System parses proposal content to extract PPS decisions and rationale  
5. **Deal Arc Constructed:** Proposal data combined with CRM, calls, emails to show complete deal evolution  
6. **Outcome Linked:** When deal closes (won or lost), strategy patterns correlated with result

# **7\. The Deal Arc: From Proposals to Intelligence**

## **What is a Deal Arc?**

A **Deal Arc** is the complete narrative of how deal strategy evolved from first contact to outcome. It combines data from multiple systems to show not just *what happened* but *why strategic decisions were made* at each stage.

## **Data Sources for Deal Arcs**

| Data Source | What It Contributes | Integration |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Deeldesk Proposals** | Positioning, pricing, solutioning decisions; iteration history; rationale | Native (primary data source) |
| **CRM** | Deal stages, close dates, deal value, account context | Salesforce, HubSpot API |
| **Call Recordings** | Discovery findings, customer objections, competitive mentions | Gong, Chorus API |
| **Email/Calendar** | Meeting cadence, stakeholder engagement, timeline | Google, Microsoft API |
| **Documents** | SOWs, contracts, technical specs | Google Drive, SharePoint |

## **Example Deal Arc**

| Date | Event | Strategy Signal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Jan 15 | Discovery call (Gong) | Customer mentions Competitor X; budget \~$200K |
| Jan 18 | Proposal v1 created (Deeldesk) | Positioned on integration; Enterprise tier; 15% discount |
| Jan 22 | Technical call (Gong) | Customer concerned about implementation timeline |
| Jan 23 | Proposal v2 created (Deeldesk) | Added phased implementation; emphasized PS support; kept pricing |
| Jan 28 | Proposal v3 created (Deeldesk) | Reduced scope to Phase 1 only; dropped to 20% discount |
| Feb 5 | Deal closed-won (CRM) | Phased approach \+ implementation emphasis correlated with win |

## **Deal Arc Analytics**

With complete Deal Arcs across the organization, enterprises can finally answer:

* What positioning patterns correlate with wins against Competitor X?  
* At what iteration count do deals typically close? (Strategy maturity signal)  
* Which pricing structures win in this industry vertical?  
* What's the impact of adding PS emphasis after implementation concerns?  
* How do top performers' proposal patterns differ from average reps?

# **9\. Technical Architecture: Context Store \+ Smart Retrieval**

The ability to generate high-quality, contextual proposals depends on a sophisticated architecture that maintains persistent business knowledge while enabling deal-specific customization.

## **The Context Hierarchy**

| Layer | Contents | Update Frequency |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Company Knowledge** | Products, SKUs, pricing rules, templates, competitive intel, brand guidelines | Rarely (admin-managed) |
| **Team Context** | Regional playbooks, vertical positioning, team quotas, local templates | Periodically (team leads) |
| **Historical Patterns** | Past proposals, win/loss correlations, positioning effectiveness | Continuously (learned from usage) |
| **Deal Context** | Customer details, competitive landscape, requirements, proposal iterations | Per-deal (seller-driven) |
| **Session Context** | Current conversation, working draft, iteration in progress | Real-time |

## **Context Assembly for Proposal Generation**

When a seller requests a proposal, the Context Assembly Engine dynamically retrieves relevant information:

7. **Parse Request:** Extract customer, competitor, industry, use case from seller's prompt  
8. **Retrieve Company Context:** Relevant products, pricing, competitive battlecards, approved templates  
9. **Retrieve Similar Deals:** Past proposals for similar customer profiles, competitors, use cases  
10. **Assemble Context:** Combine into optimized context window for LLM  
11. **Generate Proposal:** LLM creates presentation using full context  
12. **Extract Strategy Data:** Parse output to capture PPS decisions for Deal Arc

## **Why This Architecture Matters**

* **No Re-prompting:** Sellers don't re-explain company products every time—context is persistent  
* **Consistent Quality:** All proposals draw from same approved knowledge base  
* **Pattern Learning:** System learns from past proposals to improve recommendations  
* **Deal Arc Foundation:** Extracted strategy data structured for analytics

# **10\. Security & Data Sovereignty**

Proposal content contains highly sensitive data: pricing strategies, competitive positioning, customer-specific configurations. Enterprise deployment requires complete data sovereignty options.

## **Multi-Tenancy Architecture**

* **Logical Isolation:** Tenant ID filtering at ORM layer; row-level security at database  
* **Physical Isolation (Enterprise):** Dedicated database, compute, and vector store per tenant  
* **Audit Logging:** Complete access trail for compliance

## **BYOX: Bring Your Own Everything**

| Option | Description | Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **BYOD** | Bring Your Own Database: customer provides PostgreSQL | All proposal data stays in customer infrastructure |
| **BYOS** | Bring Your Own Storage: customer provides S3-compatible | Generated presentations never leave customer cloud |
| **BYOL** | Bring Your Own LLM: customer provides AI endpoint | Proposal content never sent to third-party AI |

## **LLM Deployment Options**

| Option | Architecture | Best For |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Standard SaaS** | Deeldesk-managed LLM infrastructure | Most customers; fast deployment |
| **BYOL** | Customer provides API endpoint | Existing AI contracts |
| **VPC Deployment** | Deeldesk in customer VPC | Data residency requirements |
| **Air-Gapped** | Complete on-premise with local LLM | Maximum security; defense/government |

# **11\. Product-Led Growth Strategy**

## **The PLG Advantage for Indirect Capture**

PLG isn't just a go-to-market strategy—it's essential to the indirect capture approach. Sellers must *want* to use Deeldesk for the productivity benefits. If we required enterprise procurement first, we'd never capture the data.

## **The Journey: Prosumer → Team → Enterprise**

### **Stage 1: Start as Prosumer**
